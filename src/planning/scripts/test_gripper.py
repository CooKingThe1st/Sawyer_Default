    A Pick and Place example using the Rethink Inverse Kinematics
    Service which returns the joint angles a requested Cartesian Pose.
    This ROS Service client is used to request both pick and place
    poses in the /base frame of the robot.

    Note: This is a highly scripted and tuned demo. The object location
    is "known" and movement is done completely open loop. It is expected
    behavior that Sawyer will eventually mis-pick or drop the block. You
    can improve on this demo by adding perception and feedback to close
    the loop.
